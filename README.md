# selver-mcp

Let Claude shop at [Selver.ee](https://www.selver.ee) for you. Search products, build a shopping cart, and open it in your browser ready for checkout - all from a conversation with Claude.

**Works with:** Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and any MCP-compatible client.

## What you get

You tell Claude something like *"add two loaves of bread and half a kg of cucumber to my Selver cart and open it"* and Claude:

1. Searches Selver.ee for matching products
2. Picks the best options (handles weight-based goods correctly)
3. Builds a guest cart on selver.ee
4. Opens Chrome with the cart visible, ready for you to log in and pay

No credentials leave your machine. selver-mcp never sees your Selver.ee password.

## A real example: Turkish high-protein meal prep

Once installed, you can chain selver-mcp with Claude's normal capabilities. A real session:

**1. The prompt** (in Estonian - works equally well in English):

![Prompt: find 3 Turkish high-protein recipes, search Selver for the ingredients, add enough for 5 portions x ~50g protein each, then write the final recipes back to chat](examples/images/01-prompt.png)

> 1) Otsi netist 3 Türgi-pärast, valgurohket retsepti
> 2) Otsi Selverist vajaminevad koostisosad (kui täpne on puudu, siis asenda sobivaga)
> 3) Pane neid ostukorvi koguses, et saaksin iga rooga 5 portsionit, igas portsjonis ~50g valku
> 4) kirjuta lõplikud retseptid mulle siia chati

**2. Claude's reply** - real Estonian recipes with measured ingredients and steps:

![Recipe output: "Tavuk Şiş - Türgi jogurtikanavardad", 51g protein per portion, full ingredient list and cooking steps in Estonian](examples/images/02-recipe.png)

**3. The cart, populated and ready for checkout** - opens automatically in Chrome after Claude finishes reasoning:

![Selver cart showing chicken, ground beef, Greek yogurt, bulgur, feta, baby spinach, tomatoes, crushed tomatoes and more - 124.84€ total](examples/images/03-cart.png)

All in one conversation. Claude handles recipe research, ingredient mapping to real SKUs (substituting when exact matches are out of stock), weight-based quantity math (chicken by kg, spinach by weight step), and the browser orchestration that shows you the cart ready to check out.

## Easiest install: let your AI agent do it

If you already have an AI coding agent with shell and filesystem access - **Claude Code** works out of the box, Claude Desktop works if you have a filesystem or shell MCP installed - the fastest install is to paste this prompt:

> Please install selver-mcp from https://github.com/martparve/selver-mcp following its README. Set up both MCPs (selver-mcp and chrome-devtools) for my client, and do the post-install step for getting the cart workflow into context (skill file for Claude Code, memory for Claude Desktop). Then tell me to restart.

The agent will clone the repo, run `npm install && npm run build`, wire up the MCPs in your config file, and handle the workflow-in-context step appropriate for your client.

If your agent doesn't have those permissions (browser-only ChatGPT, Claude.ai web, etc.), fall back to the manual steps below.

## Prerequisites

You need **Node.js 18 or newer**. Check if you have it:

```bash
node --version
```

If you see `v18.x.x` or higher, you're set. Otherwise:

- **macOS**: easiest is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) → `brew install node`
- **Windows / Linux / any OS**: download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (pick the LTS version)

## Install - Claude Code

### 1. Download selver-mcp

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/martparve/selver-mcp.git ~/selver-mcp
cd ~/selver-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

This downloads the code, installs dependencies, and compiles it. Takes about a minute.

### 2. Connect it to Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add selver-mcp node ~/selver-mcp/dist/index.js
```

### 3. Install the browser helper

selver-mcp builds your cart on Selver's servers, but to actually **see and check out** the cart, Claude needs a browser-control helper called `chrome-devtools-mcp`. One command:

```bash
claude mcp add chrome-devtools --scope user -- npx -y chrome-devtools-mcp@latest
```

### 4. Install the skill (optional but recommended)

A skill tells Claude how to use both MCPs together automatically. Without it, you'd need to remind Claude to open the browser after building the cart.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/selver-cart
cp ~/selver-mcp/skills/selver-cart/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/selver-cart/SKILL.md
```

### 5. Restart Claude Code

Close any running Claude Code session and start a new one. The MCPs are now available.

### 6. Try it

In a new Claude Code chat, type:

> Lisa mulle Selverist 2 pätsi musta leiba ja ava cart

or in English:

> Add 2 black breads from Selver to my cart and open it in the browser

Claude should search, add, open a Chrome window showing your cart, and tell you to log in.

## Install - Claude Desktop

### 1. Download selver-mcp

Same as Claude Code step 1:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/martparve/selver-mcp.git ~/selver-mcp
cd ~/selver-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Find your Claude Desktop config file

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

If the file doesn't exist, create it.

### 3. Add both MCPs to the config

Open the config file in any text editor and paste this (if you already have other MCPs, merge the `mcpServers` section):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "selver-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/YOUR_NAME/selver-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    },
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** replace `/Users/YOUR_NAME/selver-mcp` with the actual path where you cloned the repo. On Windows this might be something like `C:\\Users\\YourName\\selver-mcp` - note the double backslashes.

### 4. Save the workflow as a Claude Desktop memory

Claude Desktop doesn't read `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or auto-discover `~/.claude/skills/` the way Claude Code does. Without the workflow in context, Claude Desktop will open an empty cart page instead of the real cart.

The fix is Claude Desktop's **memory** feature: you paste the instructions into a chat and ask Claude to save them. Memories persist across all future conversations.

**Restart Claude Desktop first** (so the new MCPs are loaded), then in a new chat paste:

> Please save the following as a memory so you always follow it when I shop at Selver.ee:
>
> ---
>
> When the user wants to shop at Selver.ee, always use BOTH `selver-mcp` (server-side cart) and `chrome-devtools` (browser) together. Neither alone is enough.
>
> After `add_to_cart` returns a `cart_token`, do all four steps in the browser:
>
> 1. Open `https://www.selver.ee` via `mcp__chrome-devtools__new_page`
> 2. Run `evaluate_script`: `localStorage.setItem('shop/cart/current-cart-token', JSON.stringify('<CART_TOKEN>'))`
> 3. Navigate to `https://www.selver.ee/cart`
> 4. Run this replay snippet (skip items already in `cartItems` to avoid doubled qty):
>
> ```js
> async () => {
>   const store = document.getElementById('app').__vue__.$store;
>   const token = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('shop/cart/current-cart-token'));
>   const serverItems = (await fetch(`/api/cart/pull?cartId=${token}&storeCode=et`).then(r => r.json())).result;
>   for (const it of serverItems) {
>     if (store.state.cart.cartItems.find(i => i.sku === it.sku)) continue;
>     const variant = await store.dispatch('cart/getProductVariant', { serverItem: it });
>     if (variant) await store.dispatch('cart/addItem', { productToAdd: variant, forceServerSilence: true });
>   }
>   await store.dispatch('cart/syncTotals', { forceServerSync: true });
> }
> ```
>
> For weight-based products (`weight_step` not null), `qty` must be a multiple of `weight_step` (e.g. 0.3, 0.6, 0.9...). Integer qty on weight goods fails with "Toote samm on muutunud".

Claude Desktop will confirm the memory was saved. From the next message onwards, it will follow this workflow automatically for any Selver request.

Full reference including pitfalls is in `skills/selver-cart/SKILL.md` in this repo.

### 5. Try it

In a new chat:

> Lisa mulle Selverist 2 pätsi leiba ja ava cart

Claude Desktop should search, add, open Chrome with the cart populated, and tell you to log in. The first time MCP tools are used, Claude Desktop will ask permission - click Allow.

## How to verify it works

Ask Claude in a new chat:

> What Selver tools do you have available?

Claude should list four tools: `search_products`, `add_to_cart`, `view_cart`, `remove_from_cart`. Plus a bunch of `chrome-devtools` tools.

## Usage examples

**Build a shopping cart and open the browser:**
> Leia mulle Selverist 5 erinevat juustu ja ava cart brauseris.

**Just search, don't commit:**
> Mis on praegu Selveris odavaim kuivtoit?

**Remove items:**
> Võta kurk ostukorvist välja.

**Start fresh:**
> Tühjenda mu Selveri cart.

### Tips

- Use Estonian search terms for best results: `leib` (bread), `piim` (milk), `muna` (egg), `kana` (chicken)
- Cart persists between conversations - pick up tomorrow where you left off
- For weight-based goods (cucumber, meat, vegetables sold by kg), Claude will automatically figure out valid quantities (e.g. 0.3 kg increments)

## Troubleshooting

**"The browser is already running" error**

Left over from a previous session. Close any orphan Chrome windows manually, or run:

```bash
pkill -f 'chrome-devtools-mcp/chrome-profile'
```

**Cart is empty in the browser even though Claude added items**

The skill handles this automatically. If you skipped the skill install, remind Claude: *"use chrome-devtools to replay the server cart items via cart/getProductVariant and cart/addItem with forceServerSilence: true"*.

**"Toote samm on muutunud" error when adding weight goods**

The product is sold in fixed kg increments (e.g. 0.3 kg). Use valid multiples: 0.3, 0.6, 0.9... Claude should handle this automatically; if not, tell it the product's `weight_step`.

**npm command not found**

You haven't installed Node.js. See the Prerequisites section above.

**claude command not found**

Claude Code CLI isn't installed or isn't on your PATH. Check the [Claude Code docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) for installation.

## Updating

When there's a new version:

```bash
cd ~/selver-mcp
git pull
npm install
npm run build
```

Then restart Claude Code or Claude Desktop.

## Uninstall

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp remove selver-mcp
claude mcp remove chrome-devtools
rm -rf ~/selver-mcp
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/selver-cart
```

**Claude Desktop:** remove the `selver-mcp` and `chrome-devtools` entries from `claude_desktop_config.json` and delete `~/selver-mcp`.

Your guest cart token lives at `~/.selver-mcp/cart.json`. Delete that to start completely fresh.

## For developers

Everything below is for people who want to understand the internals or contribute.

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_products` | Search Selver.ee by query. Returns products with prices, nutrition, stock status, and `weight_step` for weight-based goods. |
| `add_to_cart` | Add products to a guest cart by SKU. Returns server error messages verbatim (e.g. `"Toote samm on muutunud (0.3)"`). |
| `view_cart` | View cart contents and total. |
| `remove_from_cart` | Remove products from cart by SKU. |

### Checkout in a real browser - the technical reality

selver-mcp builds a Selver guest cart via the server API, but viewing and checking out that cart in the browser requires more than just opening `selver.ee/cart`. Selver's Vue Storefront SPA:

1. Isolates `localStorage` per origin, so the cart token can't be injected from outside the selver.ee page
2. In default guest mode, treats the local (empty) cart as authoritative and ignores the server's items - even though its own API call returns them

### Orchestration pattern

After `add_to_cart` returns a `cart_token`, instruct Claude to run these steps via chrome-devtools-mcp:

**Step 1:** Navigate to `https://www.selver.ee` (establishes the origin), then run:

```js
localStorage.setItem('shop/cart/current-cart-token', JSON.stringify('<CART_TOKEN>'));
```

**Step 2:** Navigate to `https://www.selver.ee/cart`.

**Step 3:** Run this snippet (pulls server items and replays them through the SPA's own add-to-cart flow with `forceServerSilence: true`, so no duplicate API calls). Note the SKU-existence check before each `addItem` - without it, items already in `cartItems` get their qty added (e.g. 0.6 kg cucumber becomes 1.2 kg) because `cart/addItem` is a merge-qty operation, not replace:

```js
const store = document.getElementById('app').__vue__.$store;
const token = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('shop/cart/current-cart-token'));
const serverItems = (await fetch(`/api/cart/pull?cartId=${token}&storeCode=et`).then(r => r.json())).result;

const added = [], skipped = [], mismatched = [];
for (const serverItem of serverItems) {
  const existing = store.state.cart.cartItems.find(i => i.sku === serverItem.sku);
  if (existing) {
    if (Math.abs(existing.qty - serverItem.qty) > 1e-4) {
      mismatched.push({ sku: serverItem.sku, client_qty: existing.qty, server_qty: serverItem.qty });
    } else {
      skipped.push(serverItem.sku);
    }
    continue;
  }
  const variant = await store.dispatch('cart/getProductVariant', { serverItem });
  if (variant) {
    await store.dispatch('cart/addItem', {
      productToAdd: variant,
      forceServerSilence: true,
    });
    added.push(serverItem.sku);
  }
}
await store.dispatch('cart/syncTotals', { forceServerSync: true });
```

Returns `{added, skipped, mismatched}`. If `mismatched` is non-empty, client and server disagree on qty for some SKU - call `cart/updateItem` with the server qty or ask the user.

**Why this works:** `getProductVariant` fetches the full product record and merges in the server's `item_id` / `quote_id`. `addItem` with `forceServerSilence: true` runs the SPA's full client-side add logic (setting internal flags, triggering reactivity) without calling the server add endpoint - since the items are already there.

### Keeping an open browser in sync

`add_to_cart` / `remove_from_cart` mutate the server cart only. A browser already open on `selver.ee/cart` has its own Vuex state that won't update automatically.

**After `add_to_cart`** - run the orchestration snippet above (replays new server items through `cart/addItem`).

**After `remove_from_cart`** - run:

```js
const store = document.getElementById('app').__vue__.$store;
const skusToRemove = ['<SKU1>', '<SKU2>'];
for (const sku of skusToRemove) {
  const item = store.state.cart.cartItems.find(i => i.sku === sku);
  if (item) await store.dispatch('cart/removeItem', { product: item });
}
```

## Running over HTTP (use it from other systems)

The stdio server talks only to the process that launched it, which is fine for a
local Claude Desktop and useless for anything else. `dist/http.js` serves the same
tools over **MCP Streamable HTTP** so a cloud agent, another machine, or a second
person's client can use it.

```
npm run build
SELVER_MCP_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32) PORT=8080 npm run start:http
```

Or as a container: `docker build -t selver-mcp . && docker run -e SELVER_MCP_TOKEN=... -p 8080:8080 selver-mcp`

| Endpoint | |
|---|---|
| `POST /mcp` | JSON-RPC — `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`. Requires `Authorization: Bearer $SELVER_MCP_TOKEN` |
| `GET /health` | Liveness. Unauthenticated, and deliberately reveals nothing about configuration |

### Two properties worth understanding before you deploy it

**It fails closed.** With `SELVER_MCP_TOKEN` unset, every `/mcp` request gets `503`.
An unset secret must never mean "open to everyone" — this endpoint can put items in
a shopping cart.

**It is stateless, and that is what makes it shareable.** No `Mcp-Session-Id` is
issued, no SSE stream is offered, and the server remembers nothing between calls —
including your cart. Each caller carries its own **`cart_token`**:

1. Call `add_to_cart` with no `cart_token`; a new cart is created and its token is
   returned in the response.
2. Pass that `cart_token` on every later `add_to_cart` / `view_cart` /
   `remove_from_cart`.

Skip step 2 and each call creates a fresh cart. That is deliberate: the alternative —
one shared cart on the server — would put two callers' shopping in the same basket
and interleave concurrent edits. The local stdio server still remembers your cart in
`~/.selver-mcp/cart.json`, so nothing changes for existing single-user setups.

### Still true over HTTP

- **`view_cart` totals exclude VAT.** Selver's `cart/pull` API returns pre-VAT prices
  while checkout adds ~24%. The response flags this as `total_excludes_vat`. Never
  present a subtotal as final before the real checkout page.
- **A guest cart is invisible in the browser until synced** — see the browser-sync
  note above. Adding server-side does not make items appear in an open selver.ee tab.
- Nothing here logs in, holds credentials, or pays for anything.
